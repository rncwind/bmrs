# Parser library
This is a parser for the BMS file format.
Right now its goal is correctness of behaviour for what our _users_ expect as
opposed to what the informal specs say.

This means we will inherit defaults from the most popular players such as LR2.

[BMS command memo by hitkey](https://hitkey.bms.ms/cmds.htm) was invaluable when
writing this. Whilst it's rough around the edges from machine translation it's
one of the most thorough English-language documents detailing the BMS spec.
